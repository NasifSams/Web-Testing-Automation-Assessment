10.Bug/Error: In Post Vacancy page eye logo in under action has been unable to locate: "no such element: Unable to locate element" showed.

    * It seems like even with different locator strategies and extended waiting times, the element is still not being located. In such cases, there may be other factors at play, such as dynamic content loading, JavaScript-based rendering, or possible limitations imposed by the website.

11. All the possible try with different locator, strategies and xtended waiting times methods has been given under another Package called Demo. Under Demo, CNSDemo.java class has all the possible tries.


Thank you
